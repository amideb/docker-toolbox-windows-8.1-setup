# Docker Toolbox Setup Guide for Windows 8.1
A step-by-step guide to setting up Docker Toolbox on Windows 8.1, including troubleshooting tips for common issues.


## Running Docker on Windows 8.1 can be a bit tricky since Docker Desktop is not supported on Windows 8.1, and Docker Toolbox is now deprecated. However, you can still try using Docker Toolbox, as it's the best option available for Windows 8.1. If you are having trouble initializing the virtual machine, you can try the following steps:

**1.**  Make sure your processor supports virtualization and that it's enabled in the BIOS. Check the BIOS settings and ensure that Intel VT-x (for Intel processors) or AMD-V (for AMD processors) is enabled.
    
**2.**  Install the latest version of VirtualBox from [https://www.virtualbox.org/](https://www.virtualbox.org/). Docker Toolbox uses VirtualBox to create a Linux virtual machine that runs the Docker engine.
    
**3.**  Download the latest version of Docker Toolbox from [https://github.com/docker/toolbox/releases](https://github.com/docker/toolbox/releases). Install it by following the installation instructions provided.
    
**4.**  Run Docker Quickstart Terminal as an administrator. This should create a new virtual machine named "default" and set up the necessary configurations. If you face any issues during this process, take note of the error messages.
    
**5.**  If the "default" virtual machine is not being created or started correctly, you can try creating it manually. Open the VirtualBox application, and click "New" to create a new virtual machine. Configure it with the following settings:
    
    -   Type: Linux
    -   Version: Other Linux (64-bit)
    -   Memory size: At least 2 GB (2048 MB)
    -   Hard disk: Create a new virtual hard disk (at least 20 GB in size)
**6.**  Once the virtual machine is created, open its settings and make sure that the network adapter is set to "NAT."
    
**7.**  Start the virtual machine and install a Linux distribution (such as Ubuntu) that is compatible with Docker. Follow the official Docker installation guide for your chosen distribution: [https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
    
**8.**  After installing Docker in the virtual machine, you should be able to use Docker commands within the virtual machine.
    

Remember that Docker Toolbox is deprecated, and you might face compatibility issues or lack of updates. If possible, consider upgrading your operating system to Windows 10, which supports Docker Desktop and provides a more seamless Docker experience.
